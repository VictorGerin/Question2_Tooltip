# question2_Tooltip

Implement a React Tooltip component such that given any target element in a page, it will render a tooltip panel relative to the target element. Ideally the component should include some control over where the tooltip panel is positioned and what triggers it to openclose along with any other features you think would be useful for a tooltip to have.
